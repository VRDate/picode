**SET UP**

Configure this project folder as a project in Eclipse.
Use soft float raspbian (TODO check)
Install oracle Java 7 Embedded (no package manager install, just download and put in its own directory wherever you like)
Set up your networking on the PI so you can access on a network from your host machine and remote login
	(TODO more info on configuring wifi and setting up network config)
	(How to get a batch of PIs all automatically becoming visible / identifying themselves uniquely)
Configure audio to use the correct hardware 
Create a workspace folder on your PI
Copy contents of "libs" folder there (all the jars)
	(TODO simple java / beads audio testtone)
	(TODO bundle these all into a single executable jar)
Copy contents of the "bin" folder there (in fact you only need the "dynamic" package)
Copy any other data you want (e.g., samples) to some data folder as you wish (remember the location, then you can access it later)

**READY TO GO**

Use the 'java' command to run DynamoPI
	- make sure to link all of the above jars and class folders
	- make sure you use the embedded_java/bin/java command, not the default java command
	- you might like flags like "-server", "-Xmx1024M"
	
	ULTIMATELY = set this command to auto run on boot (also make sure autoconnect to wifi works)
	
Now from your master computer in Eclipse you can run "DynamicPIPO" to execute dynamic code
	- make sure to set up the Eclipse project
	- make sure to specify the hostname you want for each host (make sure you're connected to the host, remote login to check)
	- now go and dynamically modify the code, each time you run it the "action()" method gets executed on the PI
	
	
**PORTS**

PI SocketServer (listening for PIPOs): 1234
PI OSCListener (realtime control messages): 5555
PI ConnectionClient (sending status to master): 2224 (this includes any state description being sent back)
PI ConnectionClient (receives name from master): 2225

Connection server keeps a file with list of active PIs. Format is as follows:
DynamicID PIName IPAddress

**SET UP OF PI FILESYSTEM**

Home is /home/pi.
Create dir "pisound".
Install Java embedded.
Copy bin, libs, conf.
Use /etc/init.d/dynamoPI.sh to start running program.
Command (from pisound dir) is java -Xmx200m -cp .:bin:libs/beads.jar:libs/beads-io.jar:libs/NetUtil.jar:libs/tritonus_share.jar dynamic.DynamoPI
To free up space remove /usr/share/icons.
